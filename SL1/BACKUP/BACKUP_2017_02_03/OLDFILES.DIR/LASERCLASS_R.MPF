;program is used to create a table-pattern of lines
;with different speeds for each column 
;manual set parameters can be set after a row is finished, program will proceed just after a new user-input

;definition of sample parameters
R0=25					;length of the line to clad
R2=400					;number by which the feedrate is decreased each iteration
R3=4					;number of columns
R4=7					;number of rows
R5=200					;testsample Y-length
R6=50					;testsample X-length
R7=(R5-(R3*R0))/R3		;distance between lines in Y-direction
R8=(R6/R4)				;distance between lines in X-direction

;E2000					;define speed for G0-command
G0 X=-R8/2				;go to starting position
G0 Y=-R6				;go to starting position
