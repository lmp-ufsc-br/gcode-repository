;program is used to create a column with multiple rows consisting of 
;one-layer rectangle-shaped clads with different overlappings



;General Configurations-----------------------------------
N100 G91			;relative positioning
N110 G641			;turn off delay due to reading of comments
N120 G603                    ;interpolate the end of the line
N130 M55			;home mirror
N140 G4F4			;necessary delay for positioning of the mirror				
N150 M0			;stop program until next input

;R-Parameters---------------------------------------------
N160 R0=25			;width(Y-length) of one rectangle
N170 R2=10			;number of lines per rectangle
N180 R3=0.5			;overlapping percentage to start from in each column
N190 R4=0.05			;increment by which overlapping percentage will be decreased
N200 R5=3500			;feedrate X-Y-axis
N210 R6=2000			;laserpower
N220 R7=3			;number of rows
N230 R9=3.5			;space between samples and contour of sample
N240 R10=1.70		;width of the clad determined by earlier tests
N250 R12=14.5			;distance between startingpoint of rectangles

;Process Start-up------------------------------------------
N260 M56			;set canal 1 as laser-source
N270 G4F4			;necessary delay for positioning of the mirror
N280 M0
;START POWDER!!!
